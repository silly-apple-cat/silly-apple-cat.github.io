                <h2>1970’s Disco and Synthpop Electronic Dance Music</h2>
                <p>The beginning of EDM came from the disco genre, which was very popular in the late 1970s. Disco music uses drum machines and electronic instruments to create synthesized rhythms.</p>
                <p>Some songs which helped to create the EDM scene include the 1977 synthesized disco hit "I Feel Love" by Pete Bellotte and Giorgio Moroder, and "Rock Your Baby" by George McCrae.</p>

                <h2>Synthpop, Post-Disco and Electro Music of the 1980s</h2>
                <p>Synth music, or synthpop, was developed alongside house music and electro music during the "post-disco" era in the 1980s. As technology advanced, more music of this genre was created.</p>
                <p>Music produced during this time include "Take On Me" by a-ha, and also "On and On" by Jesse Saunders.</p>

                <h2>From Popular to Mainstream: EDM in the 2000s</h2>
                <p>Electronic dance music, despite its slow start, eventually picked up popularity in the western world thanks to international DJs and music producers drawing attention to the genre.</p>
